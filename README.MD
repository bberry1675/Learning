## Version Control
Version Control software is necessary in program development to save revisons of the source code so that nothing gets lost and distributed repositories can be worked on in an organized manner. The version control for this repository and project is [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
