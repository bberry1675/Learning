# Supreme Bot Using Web Driver

## Setting up Programming Environment
The bot will use a framework called [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html) which provides an api to control a browser environment programatically. Selenium has implementations in Java, Javascript, Ruby, C#, but you mentioned how you would like to do this with Python. First you need to have python installed on your computer if you don't have it installed here is a [guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/). To check that installation worked try getting the version number from the command prompt / terminal. After installing python you will also need to have pip installed. Pip is a package manager for python and it is how you can get the selenium module into your python environment. You can find a guide on how to install pip [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). After installing python and pip we can get into installing the other software needed for this project.

With pip and Python installed you can now add selenium to your python installation using pip and the command `pip install selenium`. This will add the python module which you can use to control the driver but you will still need to install a web driver for the module. The drivers for different browsers can be found [here](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers). The driver must be made available in your PATH environment variable so the variable needs to be updated with the location of the web driver or needs to be in a location already on PATH. With the module and web driver you now have the rest of the software needed to create a bot.

## Using Selenium
Selenium will handle the communication between your program and the web driver but it is necessary to know how to target and manipulate the DOM. [This guide](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) will have useful topics in the sections 3 and 4.
